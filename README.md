# User-profiling-and-Segmentation
Overview

This project focuses on User Profiling and Segmentation using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. By analyzing user data, we aim to classify and group users into distinct segments based on their characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. This segmentation can help in crafting targeted marketing strategies, personalizing user experiences, and deriving actionable insights for business growth.

Key Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand user trends and patterns.

Clustering Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering.

Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA or t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as silhouette scores and elbow methods to assess model performance.
